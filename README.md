# Restaurant-Automation-Software (cecs343_prj)
Software Engineering Course Project for our Software Engineering Class.

## Description

This project represents software that a restaurant may want to use as a tool to encourage more efficient operations. The software contains components for storing and updating menus, orders, and prices of food items. Managers and other employees can view the tables and see the status of them. Statusâ€™ include dirty, occupied, total number of visitors, and empty. Having the layout helps the staff to see the nature of the restaurant. The software also includes a special asynchronous chat like instance that allows staff to update each other on the status of tables in the restaurant.
